# DESCRIPTION
# ===========
#
# A cross-compilation build script.
# This script is a workaround for problems related to the generated cross-compilation build.sh script.
# It addresses these problems prior by "hotfixing" the generated build.sh scripts before invoking them.
#
# PREREQUISITE
# ============
# Run the genmake command in the app's project directory.
#
# THE PROBLEM
# ===========
#
# The mal dependencies are listed as projects in the zproject_known_projects.xml file.
# However, these mal projects have blank values set as their git repository urls.
# This results in a cross-compilation build.sh file with invalid git clone commands — e.g.:
#
# git clone --quiet --depth 1  malattributes
#
# Instead of something like this:
#
# git clone --quiet --depth 1 -b v1.2.0 https://github.com/georgeslabreche/malattributes.git malattributes
#
# This can't be resolved unless we create dedicated git repositories for each mal project.
# It doesn't seem like zproject supports setting a file system path for a project directory instead of a
# repository url. Furthermore, the cross-compilation build.sh script cannot simply be edited because it 
# is generated and will be overwritten each time the app project's genmake script is invoked.
#
# THE SOLUTION
# ============
#
# This build4targets.sh script is a workaround to the aforementioned problem. It replaces the invalid git
# clone commands with commands that will copy the mal project directories where they would normally be 
# cloned into if they had dedicated repositories — i.e., into builds/rpi/tmp-deps/

# Set the bash script variables.
source env.sh

# List target environments that we want to cross-compile against.
# These tagets are listed as <target name="" /> elements in project.xml — e.g., <target name = "rpi" />

# List the mal project dependencies.

# Parse the "incremental" parameter if given.
# For the purposes of this script, an "incremental" build is understood as just rebuilding the app,
# i.e. don't rebuild the dependencies.
